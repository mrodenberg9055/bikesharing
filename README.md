# Bike Sharing Proposal

## Overview of the analysis
### Purpose
- The purpose of this analysis was to take New York ride share data and disect it to get an understanding of how the Citibike ride share works in New Your city.  From there we can take that analysis and figure out how a similar program would work in Des Moines, Iowa.  We used public ride share data provided by Citibike to create some vizualizations in Tableau to more easily show the breakdown of the data.  We also had to use some python to create some additional columns in our dataset. 

## Results of the Analysis

### Tableau Public Workbook
- The entire workbook can be found here. [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/matthew.rodenberg/viz/CitiBikeWorkbook_16364851585740/CitibikeStory?publish=yes)

### Checkout Times for Users

- It appears that the typical trip for a rider in NYC is usually between 0 and 30 mins, after you get past 1 hour there is almost no users of the bikes.  We would want to do some research on the number of people who live downtown who have a commute between 0 and 30 mins for work each day.  Des Moines is not as densly populated as NYC so commutes might be more spread out and outside of that time range. 

### Checkout Times by Gender

- There are more men who use the ride share in NYC, this could be that there are just more men who live in NYC so the number of users is higher.  Or it could be that men are just more likely to commute via bike.  It would be worth doing some demographic research on the breakdown of men vs women in NYC and see how that compares to that of Des Moines percentage wise so we can compare. 

### Trips by Weekday per Hour
![alt text](https://github.com/mrodenberg9055/bikesharing/blob/main/pictures/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20per%20Hour.PNG?raw=true)

- A lot of the traffic during the week is during the commute hours in the morning and the evening.  It would be interesting to see how many commuters there are in Des Moines and how many of those live down town.  It would also be interesting to see how many of them are now working form home due to Covid. 

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
![alt text](https://github.com/mrodenberg9055/bikesharing/blob/main/pictures/Trips%20by%20Gender.PNG?raw=true)

- Keeping the theme from the other gender breakdowns, more men are using the program during the commute hours.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday
![alt text](https://github.com/mrodenberg9055/bikesharing/blob/main/pictures/User%20Trips%20by%20Gender.PNG?raw=true)

- There are far more male subscribers than female subscribers.  There are also a higher amount of unknown customers than subscribers, since we probably have more information about them once they subscribe.  

### Gender Breakdown
![alt text](https://github.com/mrodenberg9055/bikesharing/blob/main/pictures/Gender%20Breakdown.PNG?raw=true)

- About 65% of the rides taken in NYC were by men.  

### Average Trip Duration

- As the age of the rider drops the average duration goes up.  It would be interesting to see the demographic of Des Moines downtown.  If there are more young people living downtown they might be more willing to commute further. 

## Summary
### Results of the Analysis 
- I don't think we have enough information about Des Moines and their downtown living situation to make a proposal at this point.  I think we need to dig a little deeper and figure out what comparisions we can make to NYC given that the two cities are so different.  
### Next Steps
- I think we should create a viz that shows the demographic breakdown (age, gender, etc) and compare that between NYC and Des Moines to see how the 2 compare percentage wise.  Comparing sums wouldn't make any sense because the populations are so different in size, but we could get a sense of how many men live downtown, and how old they are.
- I would also like to see how many workers have gone from a commute to working from home.  If there are less commuters then the numbers from NYC might be a little hard to compare becuase a lot of the weekday traffic seems to be from work/school commutes. It would also be interesting to see how how much of the traffic is made up of work vs student commuters.
