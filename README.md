# Bike Sharing Proposal

## Overview of the analysis
### Purpose
- The purpose of this analysis was to take New York ride share data and disect it to get an understanding of how the Citibike ride share works in New Your city.  From there we can take that analysis and figure out how a similar program would work in Des Moines, Iowa.  We used public ride share data provided by Citibike to create some vizualizations in Tableau to more easily show the breakdown of the data.  We also had to use some python to create some additional columns in our dataset.
